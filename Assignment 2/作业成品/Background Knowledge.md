Schraw, Wadkins, and Olafson in 2007 proposed three criteria for a behavior to be classified as academic procrastination: 
> it must be counterproductive, needless, and delaying. 

Steel reviewed all previous attempts to define procrastination and in 2007 indicated it is **"to voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay."**

Sabini & Silver argued that postponement and irrationality are the two key features of procrastination; **putting a task off is not procrastination, they argue, if there are rational reasons for doing so.**
